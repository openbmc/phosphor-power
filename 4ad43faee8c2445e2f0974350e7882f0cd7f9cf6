      "message": "Thank you for telling me about this; I didn\u0027t know about the std::expected class.\n\nI think in this case it would be a little confusing. The intent of this method is to return a boolean indicating if the chassis can be set to the specified power state.\n\nIf the answer is true, I would set to value to true and there would be no reason why. So std::expected would work well.\n\nIf the answer is false, then I think I would set the unexpected value to the reason.\n\nSo the caller would have a strange case where false could never be returned, or it would be unclear what to do if false were returned.\n\nI could change it to have a void return value with a string unexpected value, but then the method would probably need to be called verifyCanSetPowerState() or something. That seems less clear.\n\nI\u0027ll definitely find uses for std::expected in the future though.",
