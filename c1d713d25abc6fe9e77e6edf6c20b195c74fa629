      "message": "Note that in some code paths I think this is not caught and the app will core dump and restart.\n\nFor example:\n```\nPSUManager poll timer -\u003e PSUManager::analyze() -\u003e PowerSupply::analyze() -\u003e PowerSupply::updatePresenceGPIO() -\u003e PowerSupply::setupSensors() -\u003e PowerSupply::setupInputPowerPeakSensor() -\u003e PowerSupply::getSensorAssociations()\n```\n\nIf that is what you want that is fine. Exceptions are great for breaking out of a whole code path because you cannot continue. Just wanted to check if that is what you want.",

My question was how you wish to handle the exception.\n\nAs the code is written now, I think the application will not catch the exception anywhere. The application will core dump and be restarted by systemd. If the problem continues, systemd will stop restarting the application after 3 fails.\n\nIf that is what you want, this is not an issue. If you want the application to handle the error and continue running, you\u0027ll need to catch the exception somewhere in the call chain.",
