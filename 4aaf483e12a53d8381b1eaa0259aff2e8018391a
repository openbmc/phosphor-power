I seem to remember having a note about checking some of this, and turning on some option, but now I forget what that was.\n\nI think what this was intended to mean earlier was that it calls analyze() and reads 0x0000 for STATUS_WORD, then calls it a second time and reads 0x1000. The way you have the code now, I think the third WillOnce you added is going to return 0x00 for STATUS_MFR_SPECIFIC.\n\nWith all that said, I could be off/wrong, since I forgot what the rule was on ordering things in gmock. I also suggested that you read both STATUS_WORD and STATUS_MFR_SPECIFIC on each call through analyze.",
