      "message": "I\u0027m a little confused by this.  Looks like the \u0027powerOn\u0027 is the system state.  If the system is powered off, then pgood is off, yet we\u0027re returning chassispgood \u003d true.  The comment that is there is stating \"not in active pgood fail\", so it appears this is not really returning the pgood state, but the \"pgood state if we think the system is supposed to be on\", right?\n\nI think it would help if the first comment clarified \"If the system power is not on,...\", then maybe describing the output a little more, something like\n\n// This will return the pgood state when the system is supposed to be on, and will be used to check for pgood fails when system is on:\n// when system is supposed to be off, this returns true\n// when system is supposed to be on and pgood is in fact on, this returns true\n// when system is supposed to be on and the pgood is actually off, this returns false\n\nThoughts?",
