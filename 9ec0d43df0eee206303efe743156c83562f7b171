      "message": "Yeah, this would be clearer if I had already implemented the new pgood isolation algorithm.  That is coming in the next few commits.\n\nThe net is that I had planned to compare the actual output voltage to both the UV and OV limits when determining if a pgood fault was occurring on a rail.  I had already implemented this in the JSON config file, config file parser, and the Rail object that holds the properties from the config file.\n\nAfter talking with others I came to the conclusion that comparing with the OV limit was not necessarily a good idea for determing if a pgood fault is occuring.  So I am removing the OV limit comparison.  This caused some minor changes in the config file, parser, and Rail object.",
