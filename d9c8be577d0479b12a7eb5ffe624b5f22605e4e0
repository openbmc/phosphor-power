      "message": "Good question.\n\nThe main benefit is that the startCycle()/endCycle() pair causes stale sensors that weren\u0027t updated to be removed from D-Bus.\n\nThis would apply in a scenario where a good config file was loaded, sensors were published, and then someone did a SIGHUP to try to load a new config that was invalid.  The sensors from the previous config file would get removed from D-Bus.",
