      "message": "That is fine with me.  I was trying to balance two competing concerns:\n* Wanting to get the boot moving ASAP\n* Not hammering D-Bus and the mapper with what is essentially polling for the EM data\n\nIf you think 5 secs is a better balance point, I\u0027ll change it.\n\nIn case you are curious, I did look into trying to do this in a way that utilizes the interfacesAdded callback to avoid the \"polling\".  However, it is tricky in this situation.  We cannot call eventLoop.run() to run the event loop once because we are in the wrong event loop state.  If we leave this method, we will have to return something to the client.  I could return something special to the client (regsctl) and have it loop instead.  In that case, we are replacing object manager polling with regulators app polling.  So I just left it as is for now.",

Of course, if this only happens when something is so wrong that it will take a minute or more to show up, then it doesn\u0027t really matter.",
