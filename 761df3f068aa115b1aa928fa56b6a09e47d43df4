      "message": "High level question - are there any design updates for multi-chassis, eg in the readme or somewhere?  I believe most of our other apps have updated the designs in the readme/doc files.\n\nAre these changes in this commit basically just moves of routines/function from the psu_manager files to the chassis files?  Any new code that we should focus the review on?\n\nIs the plan to remove the copied routines/function from the psu_manager files at some later point, when the chassis files are compiled in?  How are you keeping track of what will need to be removed from the psu_manager files?\n\nLine 8 of commit message ends with \u0027:\u0027 instead of \u0027.\u0027 like the rest.\n\nMinoe: In general, the commit message contains a mix of past and present tense... I\u0027d recommend being consistent.  Eg \"Read initial... and sets...\" - should be either \"Reads...sets\" or \"Read..set\".  Eg in Test section, \"Verified\" and \"validate\" mix tense - should probably be \"Verified\"/\"Validated\" since it looks like you are saying \"The following tests _were_ done in a simulated environment.\n\nThanks.",

      "message": "There are many places in this file where it uses the D-Bus path constant POWER_OBJ_PATH, which corresponds to \"/org/openbmc/control/power0\". That path represents the state of the entire system and not a specific chassis. See phosphor-power-sequencer/docs/chassis_status.md for more information.\n\nI realize you copied this code from psu_manager.cpp, and that code only supported a single-chassis system. So you didn\u0027t make a mistake.\n\nBut this class will eventually need to change to use the chassis-specific D-Bus path. For chassis 1 the path will be \"/org/openbmc/control/power1\", for chassis 2 \"/org/openbmc/control/power2\", etc.\n\nIt is fine not to make the change yet. I haven\u0027t changed the phosphor-power-sequencer application to publish these new paths yet. Hopefully in the next month or two that will be supported.\n\nI would suggest in the future creating a commit that makes this change in all the appropriate places once the phosphor-power-sequencer enhancement is done. Please add that to your to do list.",
