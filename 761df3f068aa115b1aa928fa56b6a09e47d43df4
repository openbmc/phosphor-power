      "message": "High level question - are there any design updates for multi-chassis, eg in the readme or somewhere?  I believe most of our other apps have updated the designs in the readme/doc files.\n\nAre these changes in this commit basically just moves of routines/function from the psu_manager files to the chassis files?  Any new code that we should focus the review on?\n\nIs the plan to remove the copied routines/function from the psu_manager files at some later point, when the chassis files are compiled in?  How are you keeping track of what will need to be removed from the psu_manager files?\n\nLine 8 of commit message ends with \u0027:\u0027 instead of \u0027.\u0027 like the rest.\n\nMinoe: In general, the commit message contains a mix of past and present tense... I\u0027d recommend being consistent.  Eg \"Read initial... and sets...\" - should be either \"Reads...sets\" or \"Read..set\".  Eg in Test section, \"Verified\" and \"validate\" mix tense - should probably be \"Verified\"/\"Validated\" since it looks like you are saying \"The following tests _were_ done in a simulated environment.\n\nThanks.",
