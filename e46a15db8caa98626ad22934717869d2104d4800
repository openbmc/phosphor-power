      "message": "was this the fix for that crash due to a missing assocation?  If so, it may be better to do the try/catch right around where it is failing so that you can still get as much functionality as possible.  Since as it is now the power supply wouldn\u0027t be monitored at all, in which case it\u0027s probably better to just crash.",
