 * @class DBusInterfacesFinder
 *
 * Class that finds instances of one or more D-Bus interfaces.
 *
 * A D-Bus service name and one or more D-Bus interfaces are specified in the
 * constructor.  The class finds instances of those interfaces that are owned by
 * the service.
 *
 * The class finds the instances using two different methods:
 * - Registers an InterfacesAdded listener for the specified service.  Class is
 *   notified when a new interface instance is created on D-Bus.
 * - Queries the ObjectMapper to find interface instances that already exist.
 *
 * Utilizing both methods allows this class to be used before, during, or after
 * the service has created the interface instances.
 *
 * When an interface instance is found, the callback function specified in the
 * constructor is called.  This function will be called multiple times if
 * multiple instances are found.
