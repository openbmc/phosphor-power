      "message": "Nit: Several lines in this commit message are too long and wrap strangely in Gerrit.\n\nThe convention is that the first line (summary) is no longer than 50 characters, and the rest of the lines are limited to 72.\n\nvim will help with formatting.  I have the following line in my ~/.vimrc\n\n```\n  autocmd Filetype gitcommit  setlocal textwidth\u003d72 tabstop\u003d2 shiftwidth\u003d2 expandtab spell\n```\n\nAlso, I would recommend against mentioning specific system types like Bonnell and Rainier unless necessary.  I think these changes are specific to the ACBEL PSU type rather than the system type right?  So you could mention ACBEL PSU enhancements and regression testing on other PSU types like IBMCFFPS.",
