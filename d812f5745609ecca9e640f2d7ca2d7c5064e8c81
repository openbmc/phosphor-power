      "message": "As we discussed offline, I would suggest a class hierarchy like the following:\n* PSUManager - one object, handles D-Bus/Entity Manager queries/events, loops over all chassis\n  * Chassis - one per physical chassis.  Checks the chassis state.  Loops over all PSUs within the chassis\n    * PowerSupply - one per PSU.  Few/no changes from current class.\n\nI think we don\u0027t want a bunch of PSUManager objects, because then each one will be doing expensive D-Bus queries and subscribing to D-Bus events.  Instead of receiving events one time we\u0027ll receive them many times.  This could increase some of the timing problems we\u0027ve had to work around.",
