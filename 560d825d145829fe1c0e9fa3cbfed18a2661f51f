      "message": "In your commit message you mention checking if the driver exists.  But I don\u0027t think that is what you are checking, right?  You are checking if the binding exists for a specific PSU?\n\nHere is what the directory looks like on a sample system:\n```\n# ls /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/ibm-cffps\n3-0068  3-0069  bind    uevent  unbind\n```\n\nI believe the bind and unbind \u0027files\u0027 are what is used to bind and unbind the driver.  The 3-006* entries are symbolic links; I\u0027m guessing they represent the PSUs that have been bound to the driver?",
