Sorry I did not review sooner but I was on vacation.\n\nSee my comments below regarding the commit message.  Also, make sure your commit message lines are wrapping at 72 characters.  Some appear to be a bit longer.\n\nWhen you push the updated commit message, I don\u0027t think that will cause CI to restart.  If that is true, I\u0027ll try to manually restart so we can retry it.",
