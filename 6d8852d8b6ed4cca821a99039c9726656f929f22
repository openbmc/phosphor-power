      "message": "Well we\u0027ll log an AC loss error if input_fault bit is on (as we would for vin_uv), so it would seem to follow if the input_fault bit goes off we should do the same things that we do for vin_uv going off.  I.e., if we treat those bits the same for the error happening, shouldn\u0027t we treat them the same for the error clearing?\n\nOn FSP systems we wouldn\u0027t even look at vin_uv, all latched AC detection was based on the input_fault bit.  We told the ps guys we\u0027d look at vin_uv now on bmc as well, which is fine, but that doesn\u0027t mean we can ignore the input_fault bit.",
