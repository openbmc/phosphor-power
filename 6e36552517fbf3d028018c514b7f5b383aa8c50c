      "message": "Correct, it is currently declared in the abstract device base class and defined in the MockDevice subclass.\n\nIn the next commit or two I\u0027ll be implementing the real support.  It will read the value of the PMBus command VOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT, which is the under voltage fault limit.  It will be read from sysfs from a file created by the UCD device driver.  \n\nIf the actual voltage is less than the undervoltage limit, that is another indicator of a pgood fault.  This is an optional check and lower priority than STATUS_VOUT and a GPIO.\n\nThis is actually the main reason the pgood support is being re-designed.  The STATUS_VOUT information is not reliable during the power on sequence in some cases.  And some rails do not have a readable GPIO.  So we needed a third method, especially during the power on sequence, to determine which rail failed.",
