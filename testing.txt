Tested: Ran unit tests. All successful
Tested: Changes to phosphor-power-supply/main.cpp tested by running simcics with the
        absence of the .json configuration file in either and both default locations.
        Changes to other files tested by manipulating the code to force various error paths.
        Change to loadJSONFromFile in utility.cpp tested by giving invalid "psu_config.json"
        file to main program; empty file message in this method tested by changing main() to
        let loadJSONFromFile be called when the file did not exist.
        Methods with changes that were not tested (becase they are not used by phosphor-power 
        initialization) are PMBUS::readBit() PBBUS::readBinary() and PMBUS::write()
        Methods that ar echanged bit were not directly called by phosphor-power initialization:
        PMBus::readBit(),  PMBus::readBinary() and PBBus::write().
        The log messages in these were tested by adding calls to them from PMBus::read and then
        changing code to force execution through paths that created the log messages.
