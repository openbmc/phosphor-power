      "message": "That is a good idea and something I considered.  I was just not sure how to handle it in a generic way.\n\nNot all devices in the JSON file are PMBus, and some PMBus devices don\u0027t support PAGE, so we can\u0027t auto-read PAGE and include that in the data.\n\nIn the JSON they could manually capture the PAGE register like any other register.  However, the data is currently sorted alphabetically in the error log by key name vs. sorted by capture timestamp.  So the PAGE register values would be separate from the other register values and not very useful.\n\nIf we need this in the future I\u0027ll try to think of a better way.",
