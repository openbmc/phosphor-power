/**
 * @class PresenceDetection
 *
 * Specifies how to detect whether a device is present.
 *
 * Some devices are only present in certain system configurations.  For example:
 * - A regulator is only present when a related processor or memory module is
 *   present.
 * - A system supports multiple storage backplane types, and the device only
 *   exists on one of the backplanes.
 *
 * Device presence is detected by executing actions, such as
 * ComparePresenceAction and CompareVPDAction.
 *
 * Device operations like configuration and sensor monitoring will only be
 * performed if the actions indicate the device is present.
 *
 * Device presence will only be detected once per boot of the system.  Presence
 * will be determined prior to the first device operation (such as
 * configuration).  When the system is re-booted, presence will be re-detected.
 * As a result, presence detection is not supported for devices that can be
 * removed or added (hot-plugged) while the system is booted and running.
