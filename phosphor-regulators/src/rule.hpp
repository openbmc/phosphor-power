 * A rule is a sequence of actions that can be shared by multiple voltage

 * Rules define a standard way to perform an operation.  For example, the
 * following action sequences might be sharable using a rule:
 * - Actions that set the output voltage of a regulator rail
 * - Actions that read all the sensors of a regulator rail
 * - Actions that detect down-level hardware using version registers
