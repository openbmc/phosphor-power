/**
 * @class IfAction
 *
 * Performs actions based on whether a condition is true.
 *
 * Implements the "if" action in the JSON config file.  The "if" action provides
 * a standard if/then/else structure within the JSON config file.
 *
 * The "if" action contains three parts:
 *   - condition
 *   - then clause
 *   - else clause (optional)
 *
 * The condition is a single action.  The action is executed to determine if the
 * condition is true.
 *
 * If the condition is true, the actions in the "then" clause are executed.
 *
 * If the condition is false, the actions in the "else" clause are executed (if
 * specified).
