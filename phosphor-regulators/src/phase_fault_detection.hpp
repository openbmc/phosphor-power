/**
 * @class PhaseFaultDetection
 *
 * Detects and logs redundant phase faults in a voltage regulator.
 *
 * A voltage regulator is sometimes called a "phase controller" because it
 * controls one or more phases that perform the actual voltage regulation.
 *
 * A regulator may have redundant phases.  If a redundant phase fails, the
 * regulator will continue to provide the desired output voltage.  However, a
 * phase fault error should be logged warning the user that the regulator has
 * lost redundancy.
 *
 * The technique used to detect a phase fault varies depending on the regulator
 * hardware.  Often a bit is checked in a status register.  The status register
 * could exist in the regulator or in a related I/O expander.
 *
 * Phase fault detection is executed repeatedly based on a timer.  A phase fault
 * must be detected two consecutive times before an error is logged.  This
 * provides "de-glitching" to ignore transient hardware problems.
 *
 * Phase faults are detected by executing actions.
