/**
 * @class Configuration
 *
 * Configuration changes that should be applied to a device or regulator rail.
 * These changes usually override hardware default settings.
 *
 * The most common configuration change is setting the output voltage for a
 * regulator rail.  Other examples include modifying pgood thresholds and
 * overcurrent settings.
 *
 * The configuration changes are applied during the boot before regulators are
 * enabled.
 *
 * The configuration changes are applied by executing one or more actions.
 *
 * An output voltage value can be specified if necessary.  The value will be
 * stored in the ActionEnvironment when the actions are executed.  Actions that
 * require a volts value, such as PMBusWriteVoutCommandAction, can obtain it
 * from the ActionEnvironment.
