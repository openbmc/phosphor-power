 * @class SensorMonitoring
 *
 * Defines how to read the sensors for a voltage rail, such as voltage output,
 * current output, and temperature.
 *
 * Sensor values are measured, actual values rather than target values.
 *
 * Sensors are read once per second.  The sensor values are stored on D-Bus,
 * making them available to external interfaces like Redfish.
 *
 * Sensors are read by executing actions, such as PMBusReadSensorAction.  To
 * read multiple sensors for a rail, multiple actions need to be executed.
