/**
 * @class Sensors
 *
 * Abstract base class for a service that maintains a list of voltage regulator
 * sensors.
 *
 * This service makes the voltage regulator sensors available to other BMC
 * applications.  For example, the Redfish support obtains sensor data from this
 * service.
 *
 * Each voltage rail in the system may provide multiple types of sensor data,
 * such as temperature, output voltage, and output current (see SensorType).  A
 * sensor tracks one of these data types for a voltage rail.
 *
 * Voltage regulator sensors are typically read frequently based on a timer.
 * Reading all the sensors once is called a monitoring cycle.  The application
 * will loop through all voltage rails, reading all supported sensor types for
 * each rail.  During a monitoring cycle, the following sensor service methods
 * should be called in the specified order:
 * - startCycle() // At the start of a sensor monitoring cycle
 * - startRail()  // Before reading all the sensors for one rail
 * - setValue()   // To set the value of one sensor for the current rail
 * - endRail()    // After reading all the sensors for one rail
 * - endCycle()   // At the end of a sensor monitoring cycle
 *
 * This service can be enabled or disabled.  It is typically enabled when the
 * system is powered on and voltage regulators begin producing output.  It is
 * typically disabled when the system is powered off.  It can also be
 * temporarily disabled if other BMC applications need to communicate with the
 * voltage regulator devices.  When the service is disabled, the sensors still
 * exist but are in an inactive state since their values are not being updated.
