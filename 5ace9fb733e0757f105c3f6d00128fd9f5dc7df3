Per our discussion at the team meeting, please indicate if those will be done in a future commit instead of this one.  I don\u0027t want us to forget to address the comments at some point.  \nWould also suggest, as recommended by others, to add the things to go in the future commit to it\u0027s story so we don\u0027t lose track of them.",

Patchset 5 comment was \"once we start downloading code blocks, if it fails, we should probably go back to step 2 like their charts say in ErrorProcess1. Then if it fails again, exit out after trying to put back in good state. In other words, do IBM Error11 steps...\"\n\nSo for \"Then if it fails again, exit out after trying to put back in good state.\"\n\nWill this be addressed with this commit or a future one?",
