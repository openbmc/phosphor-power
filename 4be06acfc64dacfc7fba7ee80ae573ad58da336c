On FSP we\u0027d believe the last input value (110 or 220) that was set before the loss of AC, here it looks like we\u0027ll temporarily skip the checking until AC returns, then check it at that point.  Two questions-\n1. Will we in fact keep trying to run validateConfig() until the config checking has successfully completed (ie will we keep calling it until runValidateConfig is false)?\n2. Is validateConfig() only called when the system is booting/powered on?",
