The redfish code already checks for presence when setting the State so it can get set to Absent.\n\nWhen a PS is missing:\na) on startup\n  - There will be an error log with a FRU callout that would set Functional to false, and hence Health to Critical (and State to Absent)\nb) at runtime\n - The AC cable would have to be removed first, leading to an input fault which would set available to false and Redfish Health would be Critical and State \u003d UnavailableOffline (with upcoming bmcweb change)",

      "message": "Thanks.\n\nFor the configs that only require 2 PSUs as opposed to 4, is it possible someone would actually plug in more?  The available check only runs if something was present in the first place, but what if:\n* User plugs in 3 PSs even though they only need 2\n* User notices that and removes one\n* Its presence and available state change to false\n* No PSU missing error is logged because there\u0027s an valid config check first which passes\n* Because not available, status of the 3rd PS shows Critical in the web ui?",
