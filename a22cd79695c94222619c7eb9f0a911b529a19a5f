I assume that journal messages were being written for errors accessing other GPIOs that are perhaps required by this app?  Do we need to move the journal message to a catch statement somewhere?",

The power_supply.cpp only catches read errors, maybe Brandon can comment if the power_supply.cpp should catch the error if the presence gpio does not exist.",
