      "message": "I understood from your commit message that you didn\u0027t want to write to the journal in the case of a system not supporting the \"full-load\" GPIO.\n\nWhat about the current usage of GPIOReader though?  I assume that journal messages were being written for errors accessing other GPIOs that are perhaps required by this app?  Do we need to move the journal message to a catch statement somewhere?",
