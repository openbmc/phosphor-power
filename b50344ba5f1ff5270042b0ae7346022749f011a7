      "message": "Fair question.  Currently some of the registers containing sensor values, like READ_VOUT/0x8B, are defined in the PMBus spec.  So they would be candidates to define as constants.  Some other registers, those containing the peak and valley values, are manufacturer-specific.\n\nSince I currently use a mixture of both in this testcase, and they are only used in test code, I didn\u0027t define constants.  I can if it seems like an issue though.",
