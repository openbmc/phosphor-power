      "message": "Hi,\n\nThanks for submitting this change.\n\nIt would be good to update the following regulators service files as well:\n* phosphor-regulators-monitor-enable.service\n* phosphor-regulators-monitor-disable.service\n\nThey also call a D-Bus method on the regulators app to start/stop regulator monitoring.  So they have the same dependency.\n\nDo you mind adding that to your commit?\n\nAlso, rather than have all three dependent services copy/paste the same mapper-wait lines, I think the recommended approach would be to add the following to the phosphor-regulators.service instead:\n  Type\u003ddbus\n  BusName\u003dxyz.openbmc_project.Power.Regulators\n\nI believe this causes systemd to not consider the phosphor-regulators application started until it claims that bus name.\n\nWould that accomplish what you are looking for?  If so, the mapper-wait lines could be removed from the dependent services.  That would remove a dependency on the mapper to provide synchronization.",
