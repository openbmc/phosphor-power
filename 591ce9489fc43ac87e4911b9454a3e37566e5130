      "message": "The advantage of this approach is that the generic PSU type could map to multiple config file variables.  The disadvantage is that if someone has a non-IBM PSU, they need to modify this file to add support for it.\n\nAn alternative approach would be a power_supply_interface build option that is set directly to the D-Bus interface name.  For example, -Dpower_supply_interface\u003dxyz.openbmc_project.Acme.PSU.  Then no changes are required to this file for non-IBM PSUs; it would just be a recipe change.  However, I\u0027m not sure if you want an option that granular.\n\nIs changing the interface name inside EntityManager to something generic not possible/practical?  That might avoid the need for this build option.\n\nNote that if someone does specify a different D-Bus interface, the interface will need to provide the same property names for the current C++ code to work.",
